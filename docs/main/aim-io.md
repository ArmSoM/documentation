## Interface Usage

### Debug Serial Port

Connect the USB to TTL serial cable as shown below:

![armsom-aimio-debug](/img/aim/armsom-aimio-debug.png)

| AIM-IO       | Connection  | Serial Module |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| **GND** (pin 11) | ---> | GND |
| **RX** (pin 3)  | ---> | TX |
| **TX** (pin 4) | ---> | RX |

### Ethernet Port

1. First, plug one end of the Ethernet cable into the ArmSoM-AIMâ€™s Ethernet port and connect the other end to a router, ensuring the network is functional.
2. After booting, the system will automatically assign an IP address to the Ethernet card via DHCP without any additional configuration.
3. To check the IP address in the ArmSoM-AIM Linux system, use the following command:

```bash
root@armsom-aim7:/# ip a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether c2:ed:bc:48:3b:7a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.10.106/24 brd 192.168.10.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute eth0
       valid_lft 86396sec preferred_lft 86396sec
    inet6 fe80::7351:88a9:9b4c:11be/64 scope link noprefixroute
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

After the ArmSoM-AIM boots, there are three ways to check the IP address:

- Connect to an HDMI display, log into the system, and use the terminal to enter the `ip a` command.
- Use the debug serial port terminal to enter the `ip a` command to check the IP address.
- If there is no debug serial port or HDMI display, you can check the ArmSoM-AIMâ€™s IP address through the routerâ€™s management interface. However, this method often fails to display the ArmSoM-AIMâ€™s IP address. If not visible, follow these troubleshooting steps:
    - First, check whether the Linux system has booted properly. If the ArmSoM-AIM's green LED is solid, it generally indicates a normal boot. If only the red LED is on, the system hasn't booted correctly.
    - Ensure the Ethernet cable is securely connected, or try a different cable.
    - Test with another router, as many issues arise from routers not assigning IP addresses correctly or assigning them but not displaying them in the management interface.
    - If no alternative router is available, connect an HDMI display or use the debug serial port to check the IP address.

:::tip
It is important to note that the ArmSoM-AIM automatically assigns an IP address via DHCP without any settings required.
:::

4. Use the `ping` command to check network connectivity.

The command to test network connectivity is as follows. You can interrupt the `ping` command by using the Ctrl+C shortcut:
```bash
armsom@armsom-aim7:~$ ping www.baidu.com
PING www.a.shifen.com (183.2.172.185): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 183.2.172.185: icmp_seq=0 ttl=53 time=8.370 ms

1. Use an HDMI cable to connect the ArmSoM-AIM to an HDMI display.
2. If the HDMI display outputs an image after the Linux system boots, the HDMI interface is functioning properly.

:::tip
Note that many laptops have HDMI ports that only support output functionality. This means they cannot display HDMI output from other devices on their screens. When attempting to connect the development board's HDMI to a laptop HDMI port, please confirm whether your laptop supports HDMI input functionality. If no display is shown, first check whether the system version includes a desktop environment, as server versions only show the terminal.
