# Product Introduction: AIM-IO

The AIM-IO Board is a companion board for AIM modules designed to assist developers using AIM modules in completing system and embedded board development, integrating them into final products.

Compared to the Jetson Nano Developer Kit (B01), the AIM-IO Board is of the same size but adds 2 MIPI CSI interfaces, 1 M.2 Key-E interface, and 1 MIPI DSI interface. It can run AIM modules/Jetson Nano modules to enable functionalities such as image classification, object detection, segmentation, and speech processing, applying them to various artificial intelligence projects.
