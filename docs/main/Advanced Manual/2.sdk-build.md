# 2. ArmSom-SDK Release
All products released by ArmSom will have matching Linux and Android versions of SDK, which are stored in Baidu Cloud Disk by default. Here, we take armsom-cm5io as an example to introduce how to obtain SDK and compile firmware

## 2.1 Get SDK
Click to enter the link: [Baidu Cloud Disk Link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/14qfAZM3QqgJPuFVjKRSBUw?pwd=arms )
![ArmSoM baiducloud-cm5-sdk](/img/general-tutorial/baiducloud-cm5-sdk.png)
Download all partition compressed packages to the PC

## 2.2 Unzip SDK
Put the partition compressed packages in the same directory and execute the following command to unzip:
```bash
cat rk3576_android14.tar.bz2.a* | tar xj
cd rk3576_android14
```

## 2.3 Configure product SDK
After the SDK is unzipped, you can see the git commit record:
![ArmSoM cm5io-git](/img/general-tutorial/cm5io-git.png)
This SDK is a common code for RK3576, which can build firmware for sige5 and cm5io. The patch about cm5io is stored in the above firmware link. Execute the command to merge it
```bash
git am /path/to/your/patches/*.patch
```

## 2.4 Compile SDK
After getting the SDK, compile it according to the following operations:

```
source build/envsetup.sh

lunch

./build.sh -AUKup
```

:::tip

After executing lunch, select the userdebug version of cm5io
