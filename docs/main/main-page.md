Born from a shared passion for open-source innovation and freedom, ArmSoM was established in 2021 by a team of spirited young developers.

Originally founded in Shenzhen, ArmSoM plans to relocate its headquarters to Singapore over the next three years in order to access a global pool of like-minded talent.

Our commitment is to equip the open-source community with superb hardware, robust firmware, and extensive documentation. Simultaneously upholding open-source values, we deliver customizable and dependable ODM solutions to meet business needs globally.
