# 2. Flash Image

The system images of the ArmSoM series products include a variety of root file systems. We can choose the corresponding image to download according to our needs.


:::info
The system image includes the linux kernel, basic programs, etc., and is necessary to run ArmSoM series products, so we need to install the image for the product before running the product.
:::

## 2.1 Obtain system image

Visit the Google Drive resource introduction page to obtain the system image: [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x2KOX1F4-DVyyV_9qfdH28PWIORcWH56?usp=drive_link?usp=drive_link)

:::tip
1. The default account/password of the official image is armsom/armsom.
2. The Debian system is a system compiled using the SDK officially provided by RK. It is more suitable for users with ISP, GPU, codec, and NPU requirements. Use RKDevTool to burn to eMMC, or use SDDiskTool to burn to SD card.
3. Ubuntu, Armbian, Openwrt are more choices provided by ArmSoM for open source enthusiasts.

## 2.2 Burn Debian, Android system

### 2.2.1 Burn card reader to microSD
#### Install SDDiskTool

Burning the image to eMMC requires the use of the burning tool SDDiskTool_version number.exe

Click to enter the link: [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x2KOX1F4-DVyyV_9qfdH28PWIORcWH56?usp=drive_link)

![google-SDDiskTool](/img/general-tutorial/google-sd-disk-tool.png)

After decompressing the compressed package, you can use it without installation. Double-click SD_Firmware_Tool.exe to enter the software interface.


#### Burn image

Open the executable file SD_Firmware_Tool.exe that burned SDDiskTool and insert the SD card.

First select the correct SD card to be burned, then select the function mode to SD Boot, then select the image to be burned, and finally click to start creating the burned image to the SD card.

![SDDiskTool](/img/general-tutorial/sd-disk-tool.png)

Wait patiently for the SD card to be burned completely. When the image size is larger, the burning time will be longer accordingly.

:::tip Tips
1. When you click Create, there will be a certain probability that an error message will be reported saying that it cannot be burned. You can close the error window and start creating again. If it still doesn't work, try formatting the SD card.
2. The firmware downloaded from google drive needs to be decompressed before loading, and Windows PC needs to run the tool with administrator rights before it can be executed.

### 2.2.2 USB cable burning to eMMC

We open the RKDevTool burning tool and set the product to enter burning mode.

```
1. Prepare Type-C cable for image burning
2. Disconnect all connections that may provide power to the product, such as power cords, USB cables, etc.
3. Use a Type-C cable to connect one end to the product's OTG interface and the other end to the computer's USB interface, then open the software RKDevTool
4. Press and hold the Recovery button, and then use DC to power the product
5. Wait for the software prompt to find a LOADER device (as shown in the figure below), then release the button
6. If unsuccessful, repeat steps 2-5.
```

:::tip Analysis of programming failure
If Download Boot Fail occurs during the programming process, or an error occurs during the programming process, as shown in the figure below, it is usually caused by poor connection of the USB cable used, inferior wire material, or insufficient driver capability of the computer USB port. Please replace the USB cable or Troubleshooting computer USB ports.
:::

:::note What is the difference between Maskrom mode programming and Loader mode programming?
* Maskrom: When the Flash firmware is not burned, the chip will boot into the Maskrom mode, and the initial firmware can be burned;
If the Loader fails to start normally during development and debugging, you can also enter Maskrom mode to burn firmware.
* Loader: The principle is that the pin is detected to be pressed during uboot startup. In Loader mode, firmware can be programmed and upgraded.
You can use tools to burn a partition image file separately to facilitate debugging.
