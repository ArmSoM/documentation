## 13.3 Performance monitoring tool

### 13.3.1 top

A monitoring tool that comes with the board, which can view some basic information of the process

```highlighttable
#Use command
top
```

### 13.3.2 htop

htop It is an interactive process viewer in Linux system, a text mode application (in console or X terminal), which requires ncurses. Compared with the traditional top in Linux, htop is more user-friendly. It allows users to operate interactively, supports color themes, can scroll through the process list horizontally or vertically, and supports mouse operation.

```
#Use command
htop
```

```

From the above information, we can see that the armsom sige5 CPU has 8 cores

* The cores 0-3 use 0xD05. According to the ARM\_CPU\_PART definition above, it is CORTEX\_A53.
* The core of 4-7 uses 0xD0B. According to the definition of ARM\_CPU\_PART above, it is CORTEX\_A72
* The RK3576 series chip is composed of 4xCORTEX\_A72+4xCORTEX\_A53

## 13.5 Check soc frequency

* Check soc frequency

The default is variable frequency mode, and the frequency will change with the current application

```
armsom@armsom-sige5:/sys/devices/system/cpu$ cat cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq
408000
408000
408000
408000
408000
408000
408000
408000
```

* Check the gpu frequency

The default is variable frequency mode, and the frequency will change with the current application

```
armsom@armsom-sige5:/$ cat /sys/class/devfreq/27700000.npu/cur_freq
300000000
```

* Check the npu frequency

The default is variable frequency mode, and the frequency will change with the current application

```
armsom@armsom-sige5:/$ sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/clk/clk_summary | grep npu*
scmi_clk_npu 0 0 0 200000000 0 0 50000 Y

pclk_npu_timer 0 0 0 100000000 0 0 50000 N
```

* Check DDR frequency

The default is variable frequency mode, and the frequency will change with the current application

```
armsom@armsom-sige5:/$ cat /sys/class/devfreq/dmc/cur_freq
2112000000
```

## 13.6. Check soc temperature

Use Thermal to monitor the temperature of the chip

```
# List all thermal devices
ls /sys/class/thermal
```

```
armsom@armsom-sige5:~$ ls /sys/class/thermal
cooling_device0 cooling_device2 thermal_zone0 thermal_zone2 thermal_zone4
cooling_device1 cooling_device3 thermal_zone1 thermal_zone3 thermal_zone5
```

* You can see that there are four cooling\_devices and six thermal\_zones in the file

cooling\_device is when the SOC reaches temperature control, the SOC reduces some of its own device power consumption to reduce the temperature

1. Cooling\_device0 corresponds to the frequency reduction device of the four small cores of the SOC

2. Cooling\_device1 corresponds to the frequency reduction device of two large cores of the SOC

3. Cooling\_device2 corresponds to the frequency reduction device of the other two large cores of the SOC

4. Cooling\_device3 corresponds to the frequency reduction device of the GPU of the SOC

thermal\_zone is the temperature monitoring point inside the SOC

1. thermal\_zone0 corresponds to the main temperature monitoring of the SOC, and the startup and shutdown of cooling\_device are dependent on this device

2. thermal\_zone1 corresponds to the temperature monitoring of two large cores of the SOC

3. thermal\_zone2 corresponds to the temperature monitoring of the other two large cores of SOC
4. thermal\_zone3 corresponds to the temperature monitoring of the four small cores of SOC
5. thermal\_zone4 corresponds to the temperature monitoring of the chip center
6. thermal\_zone5 corresponds to the temperature monitoring of the GPU of SOC

```
cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp
# Other temperature control monitoring points can also be operated as above to check the temperature
```

## 13.7 View or modify the soc scheduling policy

The CPU scheduling policy (cluster) of rk3576 used by armsom does not control the frequency conversion of each core separately. rk divides the 8 cores into 2 clusters

```
armsom@armsom-sige5:~$ ls /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/
policy0 policy4
```

1. 4 CORTEX\_A53 cores – policy0
2. 4 CORTEX\_A72 cores – policy4

This makes control much easier, and the overall performance of the SOC can be controlled by controlling the cluster

The method of configuring these cluster fixed frequencies is very simple

```
# View the current SOC scheduling policy
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_governor

# The actual machine runs as follows (the current SOC frequency modulation policy is ondemand)
armsom@armsom-sige5:~$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_governor
ondemand
armsom@armsom-sige5:~$

# View all SOC scheduling policies
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_available_governors

# The actual machine runs as follows (there are 7 types)
armsom@armsom-sige5:~$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_available_governors
interactive conservative ondemand userspace powersave performance schedutil
armsom@armsom-sige5:~$
```

* conservative: Dynamic frequency adjustment based on CPU load, smoothly increasing or decreasing frequency according to a certain ratio.
* ondemand: Dynamic frequency adjustment based on CPU load, with a large frequency adjustment range, can be adjusted directly to the highest or lowest frequency.
* interactive: Dynamic frequency adjustment based on CPU load, faster response time, more configurable parameters, and more flexibility than ondemand.
* userspace: Provides corresponding interfaces for user-mode applications to adjust frequency.
* powersave: Power consumption is prioritized, and the frequency is always set to the lowest value.
* performance: Performance is prioritized, and the frequency is always set to the highest value.
* schedutil: EAS uses governor. EAS (Energy Aware Scheduling) is a new generation of task scheduling strategy. It combines the CPUFreq and CPUIdle strategies. When selecting a CPU to run a task, it takes both performance and power consumption into consideration, ensuring the lowest system energy consumption without affecting performance. Schedutil scheduling policy is a CPU frequency adjustment policy specifically used for EAS

Cluster scheduling policy settings (taking policy0 as an example):

```
# This configuration requires the root user to operate
su root
# Enter your password (default is "root")

# View supported scheduling policies
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_available_governors

# Adjust to the scheduling policy you need (taking performance as an example)
echo performance > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_governor
```

Cluster fixed frequency policy settings (taking policy0 as an example):

```
# This configuration requires the root user to operate
su root
# Enter your password (default is "root")

# Adjust the policy to ``userspace``
echo userspace > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_governor

# View the available CPU frequency
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_available_frequencies

# The actual machine runs as follows (there are 8 types)
armsom@armsom-sige5:~$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_available_frequencies
408000 600000 816000 1008000 1200000 1416000 1608000 1800000
armsom@armsom-sige5:~$

# Set the frequency (set to 600MHz)
echo 600000 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_setspeed
```
The above is only temporary and will not work after reboot. If you need to fix it permanently, you can add the above command at the end of /etc/init.d/boot\_init.sh.
