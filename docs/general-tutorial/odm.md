## Development Stages

### 1. Preliminary Communication

Time: 1-2 weeks

Contents: 
* Understand project background  
* Clarify project requirements (ERD)
* Output timeline and deliverables

Communication is the first step in customization: Before contacting us, please consider your project’s overall situation (marketing, engineering, software, UX, design, sales, finance, logistics, customer service, etc.) to define clear product requirements and prepare a Product Requirements Document (PRD).  

Once you have the PRD ready, please help fill out our Engineering Requirements Document (ERD) to specify requirement details. The ERD covers the product’s technical aspects such as interfaces, operating environments, performance and lifespan, materials and project feasibility assessments.

Once the ERD is agreed upon by both sides, we will create a project timeline and corresponding deliverables. You need to pay 50% of the NRE development fee first before moving to the next stage.

### 2. Prototype Stage  

Time: 6-8 weeks

Contents:
* Hardware engineer 70%  
* Software engineer 20%
* Update ERD 10% 

The project enters the R&D stage with hardware and software engineers engaged in development. 

In the prototype stage, our engineers will design the product based on the ERD requirements and provide 2-5 free prototypes.  

If your product involves industrial design (ID) of external components (e.g. housing, covers), it can be done in parallel with the PCBA design based on your needs. Once the PCBA and ID are ready, our software team will write basic software for your team’s debugging.  

In this stage, all project stakeholders must provide feedback on the prototypes to allow us to update the ERD. According to the PRD & ERD, prototype debugging focuses mainly on the product's functional aspects.

### 3. Modification Stage

Time: 6-8 weeks  

Contents: 
* Hardware 20%
* Software 50%  
* Testing 30%

The project enters the second R&D stage for modification confirmation, performance testing, and aging based on prototype feedback.

Based on feedback from Stage 2, modify the prototype PCB and industrial design (ID), and carry out software development. Before entering Stage 3, we need to complete most hardware architectural designs in Stage 2.

Conduct prototype debugging tests for accelerated aging, performance, vibration, temperature, drop, humidity, etc.

Once 80% of the hardware architecture is completed, our software team can start writing firmware and software for your product. If your team is conducting software development, we will provide modified prototypes.  

According to the debugging test results and software development status, we can enter Stage 4, or modify prototypes again to meet the PRD and ERD requirements more strictly.

### 4. Final Prototype  

Time: 6 weeks

Contents:  
* Hardware 20% 
* Software 50%
* Certification testing 30%   

The final prototype can go into production. Hardware changes should be avoided at this stage, but software can still be continuously revised.

According to your ERD specifications, the final prototype will be sent to external test labs for certification testing such as CE, ROHS and FCC. 

Once your team is satisfied with the results, you will receive previously agreed ERD deliverables indicating production readiness.  

### 5. Mass Production Stage

Time: 6 weeks   

Contents:
* MOQ: 500 units 
* Support hardware/software DFM
* Mass production SOP + QC

Once the hardware and software are synchronized and release-ready, we can proceed with mass production. Conduct a pilot run of 100 units first to confirm no issues with SOP & QC.  

Upon successful piloting, there will be mass production stage , with a minimum order quantity of 500 units. At this stage, customers can assign their own or third-party QC personnel for quality control.

Pilot run testing:
* Assembly standard operating procedures (SOP)  
* Quality control stations & hardware testing
* Product assembly precision, cycle times, ease of operation, safety
* Software/firmware programming (e.g. MAC addresses, serial numbers) 
* Packaging and serialization
